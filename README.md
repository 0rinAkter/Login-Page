# Login-Page 

This project showcases a modern and user-friendly login page design with a clean and minimalistic layout. The interface includes input fields for email and password, ensuring a seamless user experience with placeholder text for guidance. It features a "Remember Me" checkbox for saving login sessions and links for resetting forgotten passwords and creating new accounts, making it highly functional. The design is visually appealing, with a gradient purple background and a glowing border around the login form, emphasizing aesthetics and accessibility. The layout is well-suited for integration into various web or mobile applications and can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with backend support for authentication through frameworks like Django, Flask, or Node.js. This login page is an excellent starting point for projects requiring a modern, responsive, and intuitive authentication interface.
